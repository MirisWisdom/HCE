# Welcome

This repository is the culmination of malicious compliance spanning two or three years. What you'll find here is the source code for a few nifty projects such as:

- **[HXE Kernel](hxe/kernel)**, which is a turbocharging wrapper for `haloce.exe`;
- **[SPV3 Loader](spv3/loader)**, which will make or break your SPV3 experience;
- **[Bbkpify](spv3/legacy/bbkpify)**, which replaces Sapien bitmaps with placeholders;
- **[Eaxir](hce/eaxir)**, which installs and enables EAX on HCE and SPV3.

Down the rabbit hole lies much more suffering, and if you're keen to see a bit of passionate projects that never saw the light, check out the [SPV3](spv3/legacy) and [HCE](hce/legacy) legacy folders.

# Contributing

Most projects are .NET C# solutions. Depending on the solution, you'll either have to adhere to the standard .NET coding conventions; or if you're unlucky: two spaces, vertical alignment.

2. Clone this repository to your data centre (don't use mobile data!);
3. Hack and cry through the repository and contribute to the best of your abilities;
4. Push to GitHub and open up a Pull Request which eloquently outlines what the PR is about;
5. Enjoy leaving your mark into the epitome of insanity.

# Licence

Each project has its own licence, though most are permissive and one or two may coerce you into sharing your derivative work's source code for the benefit of society and detriment of enterprises & corporations.
