# Community

This repository is kept up for preservation; development is no longer carried out. As of March 2021, I'm no longer associated with the HCE community and SPV3 project. By virtue, I'm no longer developing or maintaining anything in this repository. The lads and lasses at SPV3 have forked this repository for continued developement.

# Welcome

This repository was the culmination of malicious compliance spanning three or four years. What you'll find here is the source code for a few nifty projects such as:

- **[HXE Kernel](hxe/kernel)**, which is a turbocharging wrapper for `haloce.exe`;
- **[SPV3 Loader](spv3/loader)**, which will make or break your SPV3 experience;
- **[Bbkpify](spv3/legacy/bbkpify)**, which replaces Sapien bitmaps with placeholders;
- **[Eaxir](hce/eaxir)**, which installs and enables EAX on HCE and SPV3.

Down the rabbit hole lies much more suffering, and if you're keen to see a bit of passionate projects that never saw the light, check out the [SPV3](spv3/legacy) and [HCE](hce/legacy) legacy folders.

# Licence

Each project has its own licence, though most are permissive and one or two may coerce you into sharing your derivative work's source code for the benefit of society and detriment of enterprises & corporations.
